A good understanding of Python and Django would be beneficial to helping you create this project. However, it is always good practice to refer to the Documentation available when developing ***any*** project. 

_Please refer to the [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) and [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/) for your reference._

_The standard shell of Python, or REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) allows you to run Python code interactively as you work on a project or are in the process of learning this programming language. You may find it useful to vist the [Getting the Most Out of the Python Standard REPL website](https://realpython.com/python-repl/) to further your understanding and produce better results._

## Project Structure

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python** >= 3: Make sure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Django** >= 4: Download the latest version of Django by visiting their website [Django Download](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/).



### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the Repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AmberForrester/Developer-Platform
  ```

2. **Set up a Virtual Environment:**

Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate your dependencies.
  ```bash
  python -m venv env
  .\env\Scripts\Activate
  ```

3. **Navigate to the project directory:**
  ```bash
  cd .\devsearch\
  ```

4. **Install Required Dependencies:** 

- For **Windows users:** Run the following command to install the `windows-curses` package:
  ```bash
  pip install windows-curses
  ```
- For **Linux/macOS users:** No additional dependencies are needed, as `curses` is already part of the Python standard library.

5. **Add your own sample text:**
- You can add or modify the `text.txt` file to include your own sample text that users will type during the test. 
- Each line in the `text.txt` file should contain a different sentence or paragraph for the test.

### How to Run the Application

Once you've cloned the project and installed Python, follow these steps to run the typing test:

1. Open your terminal in the project directory and run the following command: 
   ```bash
   python speedTest.py
   ```

2. You will be greeted with a welcome screen. Press any key to begin the test.

3. Type the displayed text as quickly and accurately as you can.

4. Press any key to start a new test or `Esc` to exit the program.



## How the Test Works

- **Words Per Minute (WPM):** Your typing speed is calculated based on the total number of characters typed (including mistakes). The WPM is updated in real-time as you type. </br>

- **Errors:** Incorrect characters are highlighted in red, and the error count is displayed. </br>

- **Completion:** When you finish typing the entire sentence or paragraph correctly, the test ends and your final WPM and error count are displayed. </br>

# Example Output
```vbnet
    Hello world my name is Amber and I am a full stack developer.
    WPM: 68 | Errors: 3
    You completed the text! Press any key to play again or Esc to quit.
```
